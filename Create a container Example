#next is to use docker compose to manage multople microservices aka many containers all together
#docker compose use the YAML file (docker-compose.yml) => this file is the glue that sticks all the application microservises together, it describes how Docker should build and deploy the app. 
docker-compose --version 
#docker compose should have Dockerfile used to build the image, and the docker-compose YAML file, plus the app.py for the application code, and the requirements.txt that list te Python packages required for the app.
docker-compose up &  << this will run the app.py with Flask web framework, use Dockerfile to build image, use docker-compose to glue all applications files together and use requirenment.txt to run required libraries
docker container ls << check the port for web browser 
docker-compose down << take down

docker-compose run $ << make sure we have the docker-compose.yml file ready which contains version, services, volumn => a ton of them
docker-compose down  << take down the compose

#Dockerfile is basically a file that contains everything it needed to build an image for the container. The format is: FROM <image used>, RUN <install the dependency>, WKDIR <the dicrectory the image will be build on>
#each of these instruction will stack up one on top of another to build an image. This is why our image will have many layers.
