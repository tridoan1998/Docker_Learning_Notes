Kubernetes used to deploy and maintain microservices. 
Kubertenes is a node cluster.
Controller: which has cluster stage and the desired stage.
Scheduler:
Manager:
Microservies: small, autonomus software with work together. 
Pods: wrap around containers, and Kubernetes cluster will be running these pods.
Steps of Deployment on Kubernetes: create the microservices, pack it into container, pack those containers inside the pods, and then deploy it to the API server. 
#practice commands to deploy Kubernetes:
kubectl apply -f yamlfile.yml
#in the YAML file, there will be dependencies and requirement to run the pod, this included the containers created inside the file.
kubectl apply -f <yaml file name> << deployment our pod to the kubernetes cluster 
#underand of the YAML file is nesscessary because our pod is built upon it.
